# Logistic_regression_iris_dataset

This data set is composed of 150 rows and 6 columns. The independent features are Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width. The dependent feature is the Species column. The species column has three unique values, namely, Iris setosa, iris versicolour, and iris virginica.

To simplify things, I limited the Species categories to two values -- "setosa" and "not setosa". I split my dataset into training and test sets and built a logistic regression model to get predicted values. I then compared these predicted values to the test (dependent) values using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores.
